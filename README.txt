Story:
  Years have passed since the Great War. In the aftermath, the Chickens have
  become enslaved by their nemesis, the Farmers. But now, one brave Chicken will
  attempt the impossible: escape! He will need your help to solve the traps
  placed by the Farmer Overlords. Will you join this Chicken on his crusade to
  save his people by throwing cheese???

Controls:
  - use the directional buttons to move the player around the maze
  - collect the cheese in order to use it against the obstacles
  - use the space bar to launch your cheese projectiles
  - use the backspace key or escape key to go back to the main menu

Contributions:
  Carlos
    - optimized game engine
    - developed level loader
    - implemented particles
    - shader programming
    - projectile movement

  Akhil
    - utilized sound engine
    - level designer
    - menu designer
    - designed the other graphics
    - collision detection

Implementation:
  We utilized the C++ programming language in combination with OpenGL. In
  addition, many libraries were used such as irrKlang for sound, GLU/GLUT for
  easier OpenGL, SOIL for easy texture, and GLEW for shader programming. The
  engine for this game is based on the game engine developed during class.

  Beyond the base game engine, we utilized a generic level loader that made 
  level design and implementation simple. Moreover, we made use of particles and
  a custom shader program for changing their RGB values.

  In total, 5 levels were created for the user. Completing all 5 levels will
  return the user to the main menu. During the game, the user can press the
  backspace/escape key to display the pause menu, which allows to the resume the
  game, return to the main menu, or quit.

  Future work includes fixing minor bugs, implementing a procedural level
  generator, creating a user level editor, adding more obstacles and weapons, as
  well as a possible boss fight.
